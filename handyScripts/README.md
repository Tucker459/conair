# HandyScripts

These scripts were used in the data extraction and cleaning process. I used these scripts to unzip, remove headers, subset and combine data. Writing these scripts allowed me to automate a lot of task especially with data of this size and it allowed to me clean my data effectively using [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/).
